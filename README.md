## What's this?

MULTIPLAYER SNAKE!
You can start a room for two players and it will give you a code to share with a friend. They can then enter that and join your existing game with their own snake.

### What can you do?

- The snakes are controlled by the arrow keys.
- Avoid the walls and don't run into yourselves.
- Catch the food to grow your snake.
